simply drop in your custom scripts folder and make the following two changes to baseweapon

around line 1630 toward the end of the onhit method change the following check as such

if ( a != null )
a.OnHit( attacker, defender, damage );
// added for cleric spells
PlayerEvent.InvokeHitByWeapon(attacker, defender, damage, a);
// end added 

and at the top at the end of the using statements add the following to the bottom

using Server.Spells.Custom;




now enjoy.
